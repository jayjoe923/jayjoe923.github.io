	<p>So far in Computer Science I have learned the background of HTML. I have learned that it is a sandwhich language, using angle brackets, and that the second bracket alwas has a slash before the command. The two sections main sections are the head and the body. The head is where you style and give character, such as size, color, opacity, and design, to what you put in the body. In the body there are divs. These divs are where you add to the code. For example, if I wanted to add a square I would write div id="square" and then style that square in the head. I enjoy the struggle of firguring out a difficult problem. However, I feel I know little about the language and am sometimes frustrated in class. </p>

	<p>As the year progresses and my website begins to take form I am feeling nervous. Every time I go to write a peice of code it always takes me a while to debug. Even when I try to research the answer online often the code the suggest just leads to other problems. However, I am learning a lot. I have learned the difference between a id and a class and how to call upon them in the head section. I learned how to apply padding to text or an image, use rgb to defines colors, and apply background images. However, my image repeats many times on my website and I would like it to take up the entire screen. When I attempt to do this my menu bar does not work. I want to add things to my home page on my website but everytime I do somrhting else fails. For example today I tried to add a title to my website but when I did my menu bar dissapeared and the links lost all their styline. SOmething cool that I learned was how to call things from desktop into my code and then they can be hyperlinked not from the internet but from my desktop.</p>

	<p>The animation I made is a square that both changes color and moves using keyframe. I set a div for the animation and then named the animationa and then depending on the percent of time through the animation the square moves. I learned that animation-iteration-count, and what position-relative means as well. Using inspiration from the web site it made it much easier to learn how to use keyframe. When it did not work I was able to work through the problems and use website to see where my mistakes were.</p>

	<p>The mouse follower I made uses and event listener. It is a pre made function that track the actions I make including where my mouse is. WHen my mouse moves it notifies my computer to move the "box" div I created to my mouse. I subtract 80 pixels from my mouse locations so the image is centered on my mouse. I am very interested with using other functions in event Listener especially kep press to make new games.
